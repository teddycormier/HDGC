        <p>The website I am creating will be for my families Disk Golf Course. We currently do not have a website because it is very private. My dad has been looking to host charity events on the course and was exploring the idea of creating a webpage for the course. The first page will be the home page ("about me" page). The second page will show events. The third page will be FAQS. The fourth page will be about the different holes (active map?)</p>
